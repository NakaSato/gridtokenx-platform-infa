# GridTokenX Workflows Index

Complete guide to developing with the GridTokenX platform.

## Quick Start

New to GridTokenX? Follow these core steps:

1. [Environment Setup](./environment-setup.md) - Install dependencies (OrbStack focus)
2. [Project Overview](./project-overview.md) - Understand the decentralized architecture
3. [Start Development](./start-dev.md) - Launch the platform with `./scripts/app.sh start`
4. [Admin Registration](./admin-register.md) - Create your first admin user

## Workflow Categories

| [Grafana Stack](./grafana-stack.md) | Custom dashboards and alert rules |
| [Testing](./testing.md) | Unit, integration, and e2e test suites |
| [Build & Deploy](./build-deploy.md) | Docker builds and deployment pipelines |

### 🔧 system Operations

| Workflow | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Docker Services](./docker-services.md) | Manage infrastructure (Redis, Kafka, Postgres) |
| [Database Management](./db-manage.md) | Direct PostgreSQL operations |
| [Blockchain Init](./blockchain-init.md) | Deploy and bootstrap Anchor programs |
| [Debugging](./debugging.md) | Troubleshooting common service issues |

## Management Tools

### 1. Unified Manager (`app.sh`)

The primary tool for platform management. Use this instead of manual `docker-compose` or `cargo run` commands where possible.

// turbo

```bash
./scripts/app.sh doctor    # Check environment health
./scripts/app.sh start     # Start all services
./scripts/app.sh status    # Check service health
./scripts/app.sh init      # Reset/Init blockchain
./scripts/app.sh stop      # Stop all services
```

### 2. Task Runner (`just`)

Used for repetitive development tasks and project maintenance.

```bash
just test        # Run all test suites
just migrate     # Apply database migrations
just db-up       # Start local development infrastructure
just clippy      # Run lints across all Rust packages
```

## Service Landscape

| Service | Protocol | Internal Link |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| **API services** | REST/WS | http://localhost:4000 |
| **Kong Gateway** | HTTP/2 | http://localhost:8000 |
| **Trading UI** | Web | http://localhost:3000 |
| **Explorer** | Web | http://localhost:3002 |
| **Grafana** | Web | http://localhost:3001 |
| **Solana RPC** | RPC | http://localhost:8899 |
