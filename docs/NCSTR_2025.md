 # GridTokenX: NCSTR 2025 Project Submission

This document contains information related to the submission of the GridTokenX project to the **National Conference on Science and Technology and Routine to Research 2025 (NCSTR 2025)**.

## Project Summary

GridTokenX is a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) energy exchange platform. It leverages blockchain technology (Solana) to ensure transparency, security, and automated settlement of energy trades between prosumers and consumers.

## Technical Highlights

- **Blockchain Backend**: Built using Solana and Anchor Framework for high-throughput, low-latency transactions.
- **Middleware**: High-performance API Gateway written in Rust (Axum, Tokio).
- **IoT Simulation**: Real-time smart meter simulation for telemetry ingestion.
- **Protocol Support**: WebSocket, Kafka, Redis, and Solana JSON-RPC.
